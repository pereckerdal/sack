;; History
;; 2011-02-01: Added level to selected force-output calls to ensure that data is actually
;;             transmitted to the client immediately on chunk write.
;; 2012-02-18: Updated the calling convention of sack:body to a more effective and functional one.
;;             See the comments inside handle-sack-response for more info.

;; TODO To specify to the server that the response is already
;; chunk-encoded, you have to specify a header like
;; ("Transfer-Encoding" . "chunked"), that is, the value must not
;; contain any whitespace, commas or any other values (for instance
;; "chunked" or "identity, chunked"). Otherwise it will not understand
;; it. To specify more than one encoding, use several header field
;; definitions.

;; TODO Implement pipelining

;; TODO Implement maximal chunk size on chunked encoding. [how to do that?]

;; TODO Implement conditional gets

;; TODO Implement partial gets

;; TODO Test that reception of chunked encoding content really works.

  ; the HTTP body based on the response-thunk 's return values, and by that the handling of this HTTP
  ; request is done, with the exception for reading the HTTP request body.
  ;      This is done by invocation to the 'sack:body environment parameter. The sack application may
  ; do this as for it to get the HTTP request body's contents. After all execution of the sack app
  ; for this request, we also run 'sack:body from here to ensure complete drainage from the HTTP
  ; connection port of the body, so that the connection is reset correctly for handling of any
  ; subsequent HTTP request in the same connection.
  ;      At the end of the handling of this request i.e. at the bottom of this procedure, 'sack:body
  ; for this request is blocked from any subsequent reading, so that just in case it'd be called
  ; by the sack app after the processing of this request has finished (by another thread etc.) it
  ; won't interfere with the handling of subsequent HTTP requests using the same connection.

  ; sack:body for the sack-application works as follows:
  ; ((environment 'sack:body) data-thunk #!key (copying? #t))
  ; If copying? is #t: data-thunk is a procedure that takes the arguments (u8v), where u8v is an
  ; u8vector containing the most recently read block/chunk of data. Sack makes no further use of u8v.
  ; If copying? is #f: data-thunk is a procedure that takes the arguments (u8v len), where u8v
  ; is an u8vector whose len first bytes contain the most recently read block/chunk of data. The
  ; data is guaranteed to be there up to and only up to that data-thunk returns.
  ;
  ; The read operation with sack:body per above returns when data-thunk returned #f or when the
  ; request body has been fully read.
  ; 
  ; sack:body returns #f if data-thunk returned #f or if the end was reached already on the previous
  ; sack:body call, otherwise #t. (Other than this, its return value is not affected by whether any
  ; data was actually read.)
  ;
  ; sack:body may be re-run at any time. If its previous return was because of end of data,
  ; the new run will just return #f . If the previous return was because data-thunk returned #f,
  ; the new sack:body run will continue reading right after the point the previous reading ended.
